## A technical perspective on the project

Cyberflexâ€™s website was created and deployed inÂ **3 days**Â to meet deadlines for their first marketing campaign.
Back then, I didnâ€™t know about [Astro](https://astro.build), so I decided to use the framework I was most comfortable with â€”Â [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). We chose [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), an open-source Content Management System (CMS), to make it easy for the client to create and manage content on their site in a budget friendly way. I quickly built content types for the different elements on the site and wrote a CI/CD pipeline that dockerizes the NextJS application and deploys it behind a reverse proxy.

### Different views for different content types

## The Result

Cyberflex already had a clear vision on how their website should look like, so my design skills werenâ€™t really required, except for creating the hover effect when you hover over a card on the site. We agreed on a very industrialized approach that lets the user focus on the cover art of the different content types and simplifies usage to a bare minimum of interaction. Considering the time it took to build the whole thing, Cyberflex website incorporates their ideal approach using state-of-the-art technologies.
